- Total patches extracted: 15000
- Patch size: 16x16 pixels

DICTIONARY LEARNING PARAMETERS
-------------------------------
- Number of dictionary atoms: 100
- Sparsity parameter (alpha): 1.0
- Number of iterations: 100
- Batch size: 200
- Algorithm: LARS (Least Angle Regression)

RESULTS
-------
- Dictionary shape: (100, 256)
- Sparse codes computed: 1000 patches
- Mean sparsity: 2.58% non-zero coefficients
- Median sparsity: 2.00%
- Mean reconstruction error (MSE): 0.007608

INTERPRETATION
--------------
The dictionary learning algorithm has learned 100 basis functions (atoms)
that can represent image patches as sparse linear combinations. Each patch is 
represented using only 2.6% of the available atoms on average,
demonstrating effective sparse representation.

The learned dictionary atoms capture local image features such as edges, textures,
and patterns that frequently appear in the dataset. These atoms can be used for:
- Image compression (sparse representation uses fewer coefficients)
- Feature extraction for classification tasks
- Image denoising and inpainting
- Understanding the structure of natural images
